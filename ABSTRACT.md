# Playing with Automated Machine Learning
## Bigfoot, Aliens, and Punxsutawney Phil

One of the coolest things about the march of technology is that eventually it
becomes cheap enough and prolific enough that you can do frivolous things with
it. If you've spent any time at all on your smartphone looking at cat videos or
used Google as a spellchecker, you know what I'm talking about. All technology
is destined for this and machine learning is no exception.

In this session, I'm going to introduce you to automated machine learningâ€”the
means by which we shall do the frivolous. What is automated machine learning?
It's machine learning that's been automated to make it more accessible to
developers and easier for data scientists. It can solve all sorts of problems,
but I'm going to use it to build regression and classification models with
ridiculous data. Don't know what regression and classification are? No worries.
I'll talk about that too.

But what ridiculous data shall we use? Well, I've got datasets of bigfoot
sightings, UFO sightings, and Punxsutaney Phil's sightings of his own shadow.
I'm sure we can code up some entertaining and elucidating models with them.
We'll be using DataRobot as our automated machine learning tool of choice, but
the principals are the same regardless of the tooling.

When we're done, you'll understand how to apply regression and classification
to your own problems, not just silly ones, and how to use automate machine
learning to do it.
